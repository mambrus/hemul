Purpose & definition
====================

Hemul is a transparent emulator for re-playing recorded contents of a file.
To be able to do that, file-contet must either contain time-stamps or flags
must be given to simulate period times.

Hemul behaviour is affected either by configuration file or by input
arguments.
