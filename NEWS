Basic function complete. From file to stdout tested only. Named pipe should
work howver. This is complete line in to complete line out, i.e. not a real
case where buffers and sizes play role. For kernel-logs this is probably so,
but we really don't want to take chanses as this is an important validator
for SAMPLER inotify feature.

An Android UART log can be re-played like this:

./hemul -i UART.txt \
   -R'(^\[[[:space:]])(.*)(\].*)' -r2

A fixed time-interval replay can me done like this:

./hemul -i UART.txt -p1000000
